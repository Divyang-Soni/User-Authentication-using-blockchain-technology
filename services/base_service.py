'''
This class is a base service which has skeleton code which needs to be followed by all service
Basically all the service will extend this class and will override 2=3 abstract methods
    1. validate_params : This method will internally call the validate method with required param lisy
    2. parse_params : This method will parse required parsed data from the params
    3. process_request : This method will process the request and return response data
